   # The directory to write all the output
   output-path: /tmp/productive

# Configure additional Harvesters below after implementing them.
# Every Harvester needs to have a unique name. Also, it needs to provide a "class", so
# the package and the name of the respective Harvester implementation. Everything else
# that is contained in the configuration is up to the respective implementation and
# will be handed to the respective Harvester.
Harvesters:
- BHL:
     class: de.biofid.services.crawler.BhlHarvester
     
     # Providing the keyword "api-key" will cause the crawler to provide the respective
     # Harvester to use this key. You may choose to provide a file were the key is stored
     # as the only value or provide the key directly here instead.
     api-key: config/bhl-api-key.txt
     
     # Overwrites the general overwriting rule for this harvester
